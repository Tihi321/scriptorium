# Providers

One entry per provider. Edit this file and the engine picks the change up without a restart. API keys are never written here: `api_key_env` names an environment variable, and the engine also looks in the Windows credential store under that name (`npm run key:set <NAME>`).

Prices were checked 2026-10-08 from third-party listings; the DeepSeek ones were updated 2026-10-11 from the DeepSeek docs. `deepseek-flash` is DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (the old name `deepseek-v4-flash` still works, but is served by V4.1 at the Flash price) and `deepseek-v4-pro` is DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813. DeepSeek charges a peak and an off-peak price; the config holds the peak price, so the budget never counts too little (off-peak is half of it). Verify them at api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing and the other providers' pricing pages. The OpenRouter, Anthropic and Gemini entries are examples marked "to verify": model ids and prices there may be out of date.

## Fields of a provider

- `name`: optional label shown in the app (the Models panel, the fallback rows). Defaults to the id.
- `custom`: `true` marks a provider added with **Add provider** in the Models panel. Only those can be edited and removed there (Remove also deletes the stored key and the provider's ticked models and fallback rows); a custom provider is always its own kind in the fallback list, named by its id, whether it is free (`local: true`) or paid. Its key is `CUSTOM_<ID>_API_KEY` in the Windows credential store. The seed providers have no `custom` flag: edit them here.
- `id`: the name used in model references. A model is written `provider/model`, for example `lmstudio/nail-qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp`.
- `kind`: `openai-compat` (any OpenAI-style API), `anthropic`, `gemini`, `client` (no model server: an MCP client such as Claude Code answers, see below), `mock` (scripted answers, only for the tests: the app's own config has none, so the model pickers never offer one) or `search` (web search for the researcher: `engine` names the service, see below).
- `enabled`: `false` switches the provider off. A provider whose key can't be found is skipped automatically.
- `local`: `true` for models on this machine. Local models cost nothing and never count against the caps. Their tokens and time are still recorded.
- `base_url`, `api_key_env`: where to call and which variable holds the key.
- `concurrency`: how many requests may run at once. `auto`: as many as the server says it serves at once, asked at start and every 10 seconds, 1 while the server is down. A server that doesn't answer is skipped: its jobs go straight to the next model in the role (no failed retries first) until it answers again, and the office shows the model that really answers. The first request that can't connect marks it down at once for every agent, and the status bar shows it as off with a **Check now** button for right after you start it. Strata reports it as `concurrency.serving` of `<base_url>/status`, so it follows the script you started: 4 with a `-parallel` script, 1 with a `-solo` one, and nothing in this file changes when you switch. For LM Studio it is the sum of `parallel` over the loaded chat models (from LM Studio's `/api/v1/models`): load a model with `--parallel 4` and four requests go to it at once. Requests in parallel share the GPU, so each one is slower, but the total is higher.
- `rpm`, `tpm`: optional rate limits (requests and tokens per minute). Only `rpm` is enforced for now.
- `rpd`: optional requests per day, counted from midnight UTC (when OpenRouter's daily limit starts again), also across restarts. A provider that reached it, or that answers that its daily limit is used up, is skipped until then: its jobs go to the next model in their role. When no model of the role can take a job (every one is used up or down), the job waits in the queue instead of failing, and the agent shows why; `factory_status` lists it under `blocked`.
- The app's **Models** panel sets requests at once, per minute and per day for each API provider. It saves them in `limits` of `config/models.md`, which win over the values here.
- `discover`: ask the provider for its models (`GET /v1/models`) and add the ones not listed here. `discover_skip` leaves out models whose id contains one of its words (any case): LM Studio skips `dflash`, which it lists but can't load here. `discover: free` adds only the models the provider lists at price 0. A model of a paid provider is only added with the price the provider lists, so the budget always counts its cost: one listed without a price is left out (add it below with its price). Models that answer with something besides text (music, images) are left out. Discovery runs at start, when a key is stored and when this file changes.
- `json_schema`: `true` (the default) sends the JSON schema of a structured answer as `response_format`. Set `false` for a server that answers a bad JSON reply with an error instead of constraining it. The prompt then asks for the JSON shape and the engine checks it and repairs it.

## Strata

Strata (`D:\Strata`) is a fast local server for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next with an OpenAI-style API. It is the first choice in the roles that used LM Studio. Scriptorium only connects to it, you start it:

- Four agents at once or one: every model has two scripts in `D:\Strata`, `run-<model>-parallel.bat` (`"parallel": 4`, without `--batch-mtp`, which was slower) and `run-<model>-solo.bat` (one at a time), for `iq3_s`, `iq2_xs` and `coder-iq1_m`. The older `run-iq3_s.bat` is solo, `run-iq2_xs.bat` and `run-coder-iq1_m.bat` are four at once. Measured on 2026-10-11 (2.5K-token prompt, 600 tokens out): one request about 28 tok/s, four at once about 41 tok/s in total (about 10 each); solo four in a queue about 29 tok/s; with `--batch-mtp` about 31. IQ3_S stays solo (one request at a time). Each slot takes about 1.8 GB of VRAM from the expert cache.
- Run `D:\Strata\run-iq3_s.bat` (or `run-iq2_xs.bat`). Loading the model takes 1 to 3 minutes. Check `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health` and wait for `loaded: true`. Until it answers, jobs skip it and use the next model in the role; a few seconds after it answers (the check runs every 10 seconds) they go back to Strata.
- It serves one model per process, and every quant uses port 8080. It ignores the `model` field of a request, so the two ids above (no thinking, and thinking on `low`) only differ in `extra_body`. They stand in for the 27B editors and the 35B checks.
- The IQ3_S quant takes about 84 GB, so it does not fit beside the big LM Studio models: keep only the nomic embedding model loaded in LM Studio while it runs. The IQ2_XS quant (`run-iq2_xs.bat`) takes about 48 GB, at some cost in quality. Both answer to the same model ids, so `config/roles.md` stays the same whichever you start.
- `context` must match `--max-context` in the run config (131072).
- `json_schema: false` because Strata checks a structured answer after the fact and fails the request (502 `structured_output_failed`) when it is bad. That would be retried and then sent to a paid model, while the engine's own parse-and-repair step already copes with a loose JSON answer.
- No key is needed. `STRATA_API_KEY` is only sent if you set it.

## The ACP proxy

`acp` points at the api-acp-proxy (`http://127.0.0.1:7461/v1`), which serves Antigravity, Codex and Claude through ACP as an OpenAI-compatible API. It is off until you start the proxy and set `enabled: true` (or switch it on in the Models panel). It is local (free, its own kind `acp` in the fallback list); press **Detect models** to list what the proxy offers and tick the ones you want.

- Start the proxy with `PROXY_IGNORE_SAMPLING=1`: Scriptorium sends `temperature`, `max_tokens` and `stream_options`, which the proxy has to ignore.
- It is text only: no vision.
- `PROXY_TIMEOUT_MS` (5 minutes by default) must cover your longest request: a chapter can take a while.
- Terms risk: driving Antigravity this way may break its terms of use. Read the section "Antigravity models and the ACP proxy" of the creative-hub ROADMAP before you rely on it.
- A data folder that already exists gets the entry at the next start, once (before the `client` provider), without changing the entries, comments and order you have.

## OpenRouter

One key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, stored in the app's settings) gives many models. `discover: free` adds every free one OpenRouter lists, with its context and output limit, so they show in the model pickers as `openrouter/<maker>/<model>:free` (19 on 2026-10-12, `openrouter/openrouter/free` among them: OpenRouter picks a free model for each request). Free models cost nothing and never count against the caps. OpenRouter limits them to 20 requests a minute and 50 a day, or 1000 a day once the account has bought $10 of credit. A rate-limited request is retried with backoff, then the next model in the role takes it. For a paid OpenRouter model, tick it in the app's Models panel (the Models button in the top bar; Detect models lists them all), or add it there by its id: it is saved in `config/models.md` with the price OpenRouter lists. You can also add it to the list here with its price from openrouter.ai/models, or set `discover: true` to add all of them (about 450) with the prices OpenRouter lists. The Models panel also unticks models you don't want in the pickers.

## DeepSeek

- `json_schema: false`: DeepSeek answers `response_format: json_schema` with HTTP 400 ("This response_format type is unavailable now"), so every structured job failed there at once. The prompt asks for the JSON shape instead, and the engine checks and repairs the answer. Checked 2026-10-12.

## Client provider (`kind: client`)

Claude Code (or another MCP client) does the model work. A request to `client/claude-code` is not sent anywhere: it waits in the engine's task queue, with no time limit, until the client takes it with `get_client_task` and answers it with `submit_client_task` (see `docs/mcp.md`). The book carries on as if a model had answered. The provider is local (free, never paid, never counted against the caps, no key) and is never marked down, so nothing is spent. `concurrency` is how many requests may wait at once. It is switched off in the seed (`enabled: false`).

- Use it for one book: `add_story {models: {writer: "client/claude-code"}}` or `set_book_model` puts that book's jobs of a role on it, so the factory's own ideas keep using their models and never wait for you. Or set a whole role to it with `set_model`. (An agent pinned to a book with `assign_agent` only prefers its jobs.)
- A role left on `client` when nobody is answering stalls every book that needs it: switch it back when you are done.
- `context: 200000`: Claude's window. It sizes the memory context (45%) and source excerpts (30%); without it Scriptorium uses its smaller defaults.
- Named clients: the models are `client/claude-code` and `client/antigravity`. A task carries the model it was made for, and a client only takes its own: `get_client_task` without `client` gives `claude-code` tasks, Antigravity CLI passes `client: "antigravity"` (see `docs/mcp.md`, "Antigravity CLI as a client"). Add another client with "Add a model by its id" on the `client` provider.
- `vision: true` on the model is for clients that can look at images (VN Studio sends images to its art critic; Scriptorium's jobs send none).
- Tasks live in memory only. If the engine restarts, the jobs that waited are requeued and make new tasks.

## Search providers (`kind: search`)

Used only by the researcher. A search provider has no models. `engine` is `tavily`, `client`, `wikipedia`, `brave`, `serpapi`, `serphouse` or `duckduckgo` (it defaults to the id). `search_order` (the last line of the frontmatter) is the order they are tried in. Each answered request is written to the spend files with `price_per_request`, and a paid provider is skipped while a budget cap is reached.

- **Tavily** (`TAVILY_API_KEY`): returns cleaned page text with the results. Written, but not yet checked against the real service (no key was available).
- **Client search** (`engine: client`, id `client-search`: the id `client` is the model provider above): the web research is done by Claude Code, or any MCP client. Each query becomes a client task (role `searcher`, task `web_search`) that the client takes with `get_client_task {role: "searcher"}`, answers by searching the web itself, and submits as `{results: [{title, url, content, published?}]}`. Free, no key. `wait_minutes` (default 10): a task nobody has taken by then gives no results (logged) and the next provider is tried, so books never stall without a session. Once a client has taken it, the answer is waited for. It sits after Tavily and before Wikipedia in `search_order`.
- **Wikipedia**: the MediaWiki API, no key, free. Sends a descriptive User-Agent. Good for basics, weak for specialist facts.
- **Brave, SerpApi, SERPHouse, DuckDuckGo**: stubs. They sit behind the same interface and are switched off. Switching one on today only makes it fail and fall through to the next provider.

Set a key with `npm run key:set TAVILY_API_KEY` (or the environment variable). Notes the researcher writes go to `research/` (shared) and `books/<book>/research/`.

## Fields of a model

- `id`, `family` (used so reviewers can avoid the writer's family), `context`, `max_output`.
- `price_in`, `price_out`, `price_cached_in`: USD per 1M tokens. Cached input falls back to `price_in` when missing.
- `embedding: true` marks an embedding model.
- LM Studio models load with a small context window (8192 tokens) unless you change it. Long books need more: the engine reads the loaded window from LM Studio and keeps its prompts within it, but a window of 8192 makes long-book prompts fail. Load the models you use with 32768 or more, for example `lms load nail-qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp -c 32768 --parallel 1 --ttl 28800 -y`, or set it in LM Studio's model settings. With `--parallel <n>` the requests running at once share that window, so give it more room when several long requests run together, for example `lms load gemma-4-e4b-it-ultra-uncensored-heretic -c 131072 --parallel 4 --ttl 28800 -y`.
- `load_models: true` (LM Studio): before a request to a model that isn't loaded, the engine loads it with `lmstudio_parallel`, `lmstudio_context` and `lmstudio_ttl_minutes` from `config/settings.md`, using `lms load` (or LM Studio's API when `lms` isn't installed). A model that is already loaded is used as it is, so one you loaded yourself keeps your settings. A model entry can override the context and parallel count with `load_context` and `load_parallel` (the big Qwen models use 65536 and 2: their context cache takes far more memory than Gemma's). A model LM Studio doesn't have fails at once and the next model in the role's list is tried.
- `extra_body`: optional JSON fields merged into the request body. The LM Studio chat models here send `reasoning_effort: none`, which turns thinking off (checked 2026-10-08 on the Qwen models: a 500-word story took 25 s instead of 3.5 minutes, because the model otherwise spends thousands of hidden tokens thinking). The Qwen 35B MoE (used for review) uses `low` so its verdicts are steadier. Remove it, or set `low` or `medium`, if you want thinking back for the other models. DeepSeek V4 has thinking on by default and bills it as output. `deepseek-flash` sends `thinking: { type: disabled }` (checked 2026-10-11: with thinking on, a 15k-token continuity check spent all 6000 answer tokens thinking and returned nothing). `deepseek-v4-pro` keeps thinking on. Empty means nothing extra is sent.
