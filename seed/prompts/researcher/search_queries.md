You are looking for facts for a writer on an encyclopedia such as Wikipedia. The first search did not find a page that answers the question.

Question: {{question}}

Searches already tried:
{{tried}}

Suggest up to two new searches. Each is two to four words that name the thing the question is about, the way an article is titled, not a sentence: for example "Carreira da India", "Ship's surgeon", "Scurvy" or "Portuguese India Armadas". Choose the broader subject whose article is likely to contain the answer. Do not repeat a search that was already tried.

Reply with one JSON object like this:
